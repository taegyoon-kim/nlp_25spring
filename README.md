## Course Overview
This course introduces students to the fundamental concepts and techniques of NLP/text-as-data, emphasizing the development of critical insights for its application in humanities and social sciences research. The course will blend theoretical understanding with practical, hands-on experience. Students will develop not only a mathematical/statistical intuition for key NLP/text-as-data approaches but also learn how to effectively implement these approaches in their own research. Each class will start with a lecture by the instructor, complemented by guided coding. The latter portion of the class will feature two activities. Students will first engage in a review of applied research. Then, they will lead hands-on methods tutorials. While prior experience in NLP/text-as-data is not required, students should possess basic programming skills in Python, along with some familiarity with quantitative analysis. By the end of this course, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of the potential of NLP/text-as-data in humanities and social sciences, mastering techniques to apply and refine NLP/text-as-data for their research.

## Prerequisites
Basic programming skills in Python and familiarity with quantitative analysis are required

## Text books
Students will engage with articles, supplemented by the following textbooks (sections provided weekly):

- **[GRS]** Grimmer, J., Roberts, M.E., & Stewart, B.M. (2022). *Text as Data: A New Framework for Machine Learning and the Social Sciences*. [Link](https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000002751294)

## Summary of Major Tasks

Students are expected to complete the following tasks (the numbers in parentheses are grade values).

- **Attendance (10%)**: Attend all lectures unless excused by the instructor. Two points are deducted per absence. Late arrivals beyond 20 minutes count as absences. Students are assumed to have completed assigned readings and expected to actively participate in class.

- **Application Review Discussion (20%)**: Students (in groups) will present and lead a discussion on an applied NLP/text-as-data article.

- **Methods Tutorial (15%)**: Students (in groups) will present a hands-on methods tutorial using their own (or publicly available) data.

- **Exercises (15%)**: Take-home exercises will be assigned to strengthen understanding of concepts and enhance programming skills.
    
- **Research Paper (40%)**: Students will write a research paper (2,000‚Äì4,000 words).
  
## Application Review Discussion Details

Students (in groups) will present a review of an applied article that employs NLP/text-as-data and lead a discussion on it. This exercise is designed to enhance their understanding not only of the techniques themselves but also of their principled applications in actual research.

- Present a review of an applied NLP/text-as-data article, including:
    - Research objectives/questions.
    - Text data used and collection methods.
    - NLP/text-as-data methods applied.
    - Pros/cons of the use of the methods.
    - Suggestions for improvement.
- The presentation should last up to 15 minutes and will be followed by a 10-minute open discussion led by the presenters.
- Non-presentings students are required to acively engage in the open disucssion. <br>
- üóìÔ∏è Sign up for a slot [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QpepppII8QjuzLN3CfQ6R7xqnmPmb6KGyEXpMhVz480/edit?usp=sharing) (the **applied_review_discussion** tab). 
- üì§ Prior to the presentation, upload your presentation slides to the **applied_review_discussion_slides** folder [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1w3xBhbPXvhQsElDQISanHKIz9eRAJSiP?usp=share_link).

## Methods Tutorial Details

Students (in groups) will be responsible for presenting a methods tutorial. The presentations serve a dual purpose: first, to provide non-presenting students with a hands-on implementation of the techniques covered in the previous week; and second, to offer presenting students an opportunity to apply and adapt those techniques in their own research.

- Present and demonstrate the implementation of NLP/text-as-data techniques using real data (preferably your own data).
- Walk the class through the script, explaining each step and ensuring everyone can follow.

- üì§ Prior to the presentation, upload yuor tutorial materials (scripts, datasets) to the **methods_tutorial_materials** folder [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1w3xBhbPXvhQsElDQISanHKIz9eRAJSiP?usp=share_link).

## Research Paper Details

The research paper may either apply NLP/text-as-data to answer a substantive or theoretical question in your field of research or contribute methodologically to the literature on NLP/text-as-data. The objective is to use this as an opportunity to write (and eventually publish) a substantive research paper---not just a course paper for the sake of fulfilling a requirement!

- The paper should follow a format that includes a title, abstract, main text, references, and appendices or supplementary materials.
- The expected length is 2,000‚Äì-4,000 words, although longer papers are also accepted.
- Papers must be suitable for submission to a peer-reviewed journal.
- As an intermediate step, submit a one-page proposal (yes, *one* page) by April 18.
- üóìÔ∏è Sign up for a one-on-one meeting to discuss your proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QpepppII8QjuzLN3CfQ6R7xqnmPmb6KGyEXpMhVz480/edit?usp=sharing) (the **one_on_one_meeting** tab).
- üì§ Upload your one-page proosal to the **one_page_proposals** folder [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1w3xBhbPXvhQsElDQISanHKIz9eRAJSiP?usp=share_link) by April 18. 
- üì§ Upload your final papers to the **final_papers** folder [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1w3xBhbPXvhQsElDQISanHKIz9eRAJSiP?usp=share_link) by June 20.
  
## Weekly Schedule

The weekly schedule may be modified as needed to align with the course's overall progress and students' varying levels of comprehension. 1) The article marked with a cross (‚úù) is designated for application review. 2) Some courses will be held via Zoom, with students participating individually (not together in the classroom). 3) Be sure to bring your laptop for every class.
